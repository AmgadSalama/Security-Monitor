## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating new issues
3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version
   - Security Monitor version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Relevant logs (sanitized)

### Suggesting Features

1. **Use the feature request template**
2. **Describe the use case** and problem you're solving
3. **Consider security implications** of new features
4. **Discuss before implementing** large features

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-monitor.git
   cd security-monitor
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 setup.py
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py
   python status_check.py
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Follow coding standards**:
   - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
   - Add docstrings to all functions and classes
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Keep functions focused and small
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **Security considerations**:
   - Never hardcode secrets or credentials
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Consider potential security implications

4. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Ensure all tests pass: `python run_tests.py`
   - Test on multiple Python versions if possible
   - Manual testing with `python demo.py`

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update README if needed
   - Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
   - Ensure code is self-documenting
   - Add inline comments for complex algorithms

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create pull request**:
   - Use the pull request template
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues
   - Include screenshots/demos if applicable

3. **Respond to feedback**:
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Update PR based on suggestions
   - Maintain professional and constructive dialogue

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles

- **Modular design**: Keep components loosely coupled
- **Security first**: Always consider security implications
- **Performance**: Monitor resource usage and optimize
- **Reliability**: Handle errors gracefully
- **Maintainability**: Write clean, readable code

### File Structure

- `security_monitor/agent/` - Monitoring agent components
- `security_monitor/dashboard/` - Web dashboard and API
- `security_monitor/detection/` - Threat detection rules
- `security_monitor/reporting/` - PDF and email reporting
- `security_monitor/database/` - Data models and database
- `security_monitor/utils/` - Utilities and configuration
- `tests/` - Test suites
- `config/` - Configuration templates

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 formatting guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local
- Add docstrings using Google style

### Testing

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests for critical operations
- Security tests for input validation
- All tests must pass before merging

### Security

- **No hardcoded credentials**: Use environment variables or config files
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **Path traversal prevention**: Validate file paths
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- **Logging**: Don't log sensitive information

## Release Process

1. **Version bump**: Update version in relevant files
2. **CHANGELOG**: Update with new features and fixes
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on multiple platforms
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed
5. **Tag release**: Create git tag with version number
6. **GitHub release**: Create release with changelog

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs, features, and questions
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general questions and community discussion
- **Security Issues**: Report privately to maintainers

## Recognition
