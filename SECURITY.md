## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Security Monitor, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly** at [amgad dot salama at acm dot org] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

2. **Use the subject line**: "Security Vulnerability in Security Monitor"

3. **Include your contact information** so we can follow up with questions

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess the vulnerability
- **Communication**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Credit**: With your permission, we will credit you for the discovery

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting user data
- Do not perform testing on production systems
- Act in good faith and avoid privacy violations

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Security Monitor, please follow these security guidelines:

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS/WSS in production environments
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Restrict dashboard access to authorized users
- Use VPN or private networks when possible

### Configuration Security
- Never commit secrets or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate API keys and passwords
- Limit agent permissions to minimum required

### Database Security
- Use encrypted connections to databases
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular database backups with encryption
- Monitor for suspicious database activity

### System Security
- Keep Security Monitor updated to latest version
- Monitor system logs for unusual activity
- Use principle of least privilege for service accounts
- Regular security audits of deployed systems

### Agent Security
- Deploy agents with minimal required permissions
- Monitor agent communications for anomalies
- Use secure channels for agent deployment
- Regular agent health checks and updates

## Security Features

Security Monitor includes several built-in security features:

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Path traversal protection for file operations
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention in web interface

### Communication Security
- WebSocket connections support secure protocols
- Authentication tokens for agent communication
- Request rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure session management

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encryption at rest
- Secure credential storage
- Data retention policies for compliance
- Audit logging for security events

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Security event detection and alerting
- Anomaly detection for system behavior
- Intrusion detection capabilities
- Automated response to threats

## Compliance

Security Monitor is designed to help with compliance frameworks:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Detection and response capabilities
- **ISO 27001**: Security monitoring and incident management
- **SOC 2**: Continuous monitoring and logging
- **PCI DSS**: Security monitoring requirements (when applicable)

## Security Hardening Guide

### Production Deployment
1. Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
2. Enable audit logging for all security events
3. Implement network segmentation
4. Use encrypted storage for databases
5. Regular security updates and patches

### Configuration Hardening
1. Change default credentials and configurations
2. Disable unnecessary features and services
3. Enable strong authentication mechanisms
4. Configure proper session timeouts
5. Implement proper error handling

### Monitoring Security
1. Monitor for failed authentication attempts
2. Alert on configuration changes
3. Track administrative actions
4. Monitor resource usage for anomalies
5. Regular security assessments
